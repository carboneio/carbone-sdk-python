$ make test
```
To uninstall the test packages:
```shell
$ make uninstall
```

### Tests - Run manually
Install:
```

```

To run all the test (-v for verbose output):
```shell
$ pytest -s -v tests
```

To run a groupe of tests:
```shell
$ pytest -s -v ./tests/test_carbone_sdk.py::TestRender
```

To run a single test:
```shell
$ pytest -s -v ./tests/test_carbone_sdk.py::TestRender::test_render_a_report_error_file_missing
```

To run a single test with all the DEBUG:
```
$ pytest ./tests/test_carbone_sdk.py::TestRender::test_render_a_report_from_an_existing_template_id --log-cli-level=10
